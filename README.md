# 22 Days

Double your max consecutive pullups in only three weeks with this mobile app.

## Acknowledgements

- Inspired by and built to accompany the [Double Your Max Pullups in 22 Days!](https://youtu.be/eb7tgP7Bla8) video by Jeff Cavaliere of [ATHLEAN-X](http://youtube.com/user/jdcav24).

## Usage/Examples

<!-- ```javascript
import Component from 'my-project'

function App() {
  return <Component />
}
``` -->

## Run Locally

See the React Native documentation for help with [Setting up the development environment to work on a React Native app.](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup)

Clone the project

```bash
  git clone git@github.com:aenyeart/22days.git
```

Go to the project directory

```bash
  cd 22days
```

Install dependencies

```bash
  npm install
```

Start the server *

```bash
  npx expo start
```

 Note: Mobile device and local machine must be on same network, and unsecured networks (e.g. coffee shop) seem to cause problems for this.
 A workaround from Expo docs:
 > First, make sure you are on the same Wi-Fi network on your computer and your device.
>
> If it still doesn't work, it may be due to the router configuration — this is common for public networks. You can work around this by choosing the "Tunnel" connection type when starting the development server, then scanning the QR code again.
>
> `npx expo start --tunnel`

If you get the following response:

``` cl
✔ The package @expo/ngrok@^4.1.0 is required to use tunnels, would you like to install it globally? … yes
Installing @expo/ngrok@^4.1.0...
Installed @expo/ngrok@^4.1.0
CommandError: Please install @expo/ngrok@^4.1.0 and try again
```

...then try running this:

``` cl
npm i @expo/ngrok@^4.1.0
```
